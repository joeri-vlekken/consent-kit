# consent-kit
**consent-kit** is a lightweight implementation of a GDPR compliant banner and modal in vanilla JavaScript.

It allows the website visitor to easily **accept all** cookies or change his/her preferences through the **preference 
screen**.

Behind the scenes, consent-kit places a cookie containing the stored preferences. The content of this cookie can then 
easily be read with 3rd party tools. (Google Tag Manager is the most popular example)
